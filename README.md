## Project Overview

The project aims to develop a video management application using Vite, React with TypeScript. The application provides functionalities for managing videos, including viewing, creating, commenting, and full-screen playback with playback control options.

### App Functionality

1. **Video List and Selection**

    - Displays a list of videos.
    - Allows users to select a video from the list.
    
2. **Create New Video**

    - Users can create a new video object with a title, description, and video URL.

3. **Comments**

    - Users can comment on videos.
    - Comments from other users are visible.
    
4. **Full-Screen Playback**

    - Supports full-screen mode for video playback.
    - Includes playback controls: play, pause, seek, and fullscreen toggle.
    - Provides options for adjusting playback speed and volume.

### Extra Functionality

1. **Search by User ID**

    - Users can search for videos based on user_id.

2. **Thumbnail Display**

    - Displays thumbnailUrl if available for a video.
    - Shows a default picture if thumbnailUrl is not provided.

### Implementation Details

1. **Reactivity**

    - All components are reactive, ensuring updates are reflected immediately after actions like video uploads or comments.

2. **Validation Rules**

    - user_id: Should follow snake_case format.
    - Comments, Title, Description: Must have a minimum length of 1 character.
    - Video URL: Must be a valid link.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository (if applicable)**
  - https://github.com/MuradAles/ScopeLabs.git
  - cd ScopeLabs

2. **Install Dependencies**
  - npm install
  <br>or
  - yarn install

3. **Get Acess from Cors (temporary)**
 - follow the link and 'Request temporary access to the demo serve', after you will get access to cors
 - https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo


### Build and Run
3. **Run the Development Server**
<br>To start the development server, run:
  - npm run dev
  <br>or
  - yarn dev
    
This will start Viteâ€™s development server, and you can view your application by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:5173.

### Build the Application
To create a production build of the application, run:
  - npm run build
  <br>or:
  - yarn build
  
This will compile your TypeScript and bundle your application using Vite.

### Preview the Production Build
You can preview the production build locally by running:
  - npm run preview
  <br>or:
  - yarn preview

This will start a local server to serve the built files, allowing you to test the production build.
